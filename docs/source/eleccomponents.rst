Electrical and Pneumatic Components
=================================== 
An overview of electrical and pnematic components. None of these will appear in the dedicated glossary given that this in itself is much like an 
electrical glossary.Broken up in two parts: 

* :ref:`electrical`
* :ref:`pneumatics`

Electrical Diagram
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wire Strippers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* A wire stripper is a small, hand-held device used to strip the electrical insulation from electric wires.
* It helps to cut off the plastic insulator around the wires so we are able to solder them and etc.

Wire Cutters
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* We use these to cut wires! (Big Surprise!)
* These also work great for cutting zip ties, you don't want to use scissors to cut them

Soldering Iron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Soldering is a way to connect two wires
* Solder melts and connects the two wires making a solid connection
* Wire sponges made of brass are used to clean the tip of the soldering iron

Shrink Tube/Heat Gun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* We use shrink tube to put over soldered wire bare connector to protect it against shocks and shorts
* The heat gun heats up the shrink tube and it shrinks around the wire, securing the connection

Wago Tool
^^^^^^^^^
* It opens the doorways on the PDP and allows the wire to enter
* It presses down the entrance place for wires of the VRM, PDP, RoboRio, and main components
* Also is very handy to use as a screwdriver on the RoboRio and other components

Anderson Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* We use these as the main connection points, think soldering, but much better
* These connect to the motors, the PDP, etc. 
* Used for larger gauge wires
* Has a specific tool to attach connector, the outer shells are the plastic black and red pieces, the actual connector is metal (see bottom right)

Ferrule Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Different connector size for different gauges of wire
* Used to connect to ports such as PDP and VRM
* Definitely use on competition bots to prevent loose wires

Power Wire (Black + Red)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* These would be connected to both the 12 volt battery and the PDP.
* Red = positive
* Black = negative
* The wires will have an adaptor so it can connect to the battery.
.. note:: 
  The battery will need an adaptor as well which you need to learn how to do but most of the batteries we have already have them

CAN Wire (Green + Yellow)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* We use CAN wire to create a CAN bus loop between the drivetrain motors and any additional motors on the robot
* CAN wire is also connected to the RoboRio, PDP, and PCM.

RoboRio 
^^^^^^^
* The RoboRio is the brain of the robot. It acts as the bridge between the code and body.
* Tells every part of the robot what to do.
* It needs a router though which is hooked up through the ethernet port.
