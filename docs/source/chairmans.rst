What is Chairman's?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chairman’s is a prestigious award given by FIRST for teams that demonstrate how they have impacted 
their communities through STEM and outreach. It basically takes into account everything else the team 
has done besides building the robots. 

Chairman’s is super important! You submit it every year! :) 

FIRST explains what the Chairman’s Award is in their Submitted Awards 
`Resource Library <https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/submitted-awards/>`_. This page will 
also have the specific requirements for submissions that year, so **READ IT CAREFULLY!** You should also check 
the Chairman’s submission format on the submission portal. Check out the :ref:`submissions` section to 
see how to do this.

How is Chairman's Broken Up?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chairman’s typically has three parts: the essay, the video, and the interview. 
All three of these help judges see the impact of your team in promoting STEM. 
So to give you some tips, we are going to break down each of these parts and go 
over how to conduct them.

The Essay
^^^^^^^^^
The Essay is the first part you should start working on RIGHT AWAY. Essays provide an
overview of the team’s history and activities over the past three years, anything ranging 
from middle school demonstrations to hosting STEM events. The max character limit for the 
Essay is 10,000 characters, so plan wisely. Below is a general idea of what info you want to include.

Possible Topics:
* When and how the team was started
* Noteworthy demographics/numbers of the team (gender, ethnicity, diversity, etc.)
  
  * FIRST loves specific numbers 
  
* Programs started by the team
* Outreach activities/events
* Student Leadership
* Partnerships or impact on other robotics teams
* Anything else about the team that the judges might find interesting

Read the "Submitted Awards" page for specific requirements for the essay. 

The Video
^^^^^^^^^
The Media Lead and other team members always help with the video portion of the award. 
The video typically includes footage and interviews from team members about their experience 
in the team. Every video is different, but the main message of the video should be about how 
our robotics team has impacted students and other youths in our communities by spreading word 
about STEM.

You should storyboard the outline of the video and figure out who you want to speak in it first. 
Then pick a few days to film, and give your Media Lead at least 1-2 weeks to work on editing. 
A week before you submit Chairman’s, review the video with some mentors and give feedback to the Media Lead. 

Read the “Submitted Awards’ page for specific requirements for the video. 


The Interview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The interview is conducted at competitions. Judges will interview 1-3 student members on the team about 
their Chairman’s submission. Interviews allow for judges to see more of a personal perspective of how 
involved with STEM and outreach you were as a student. Only one mentor can be present during the interview, 
and they must be silent the entire time. 

Interviews (last I checked) take 12 minutes total: 7 minutes for the student members to speak and 5 minutes 
for questions from the judges. Make sure you practice and time what you want to say at least a week before 
the interview date. You should make an outline of what you want your 1-3 members to mention.

Possible Topics for the Interview:
* Introduce yourself
* Clarification on past team events/activities
* Expanding on current team events/activities
* Members’ experiences on the team
* How the team promotes STEM
* Anything interesting you were not able to include in your essay
* Anything else about the team that the judges might find interesting
