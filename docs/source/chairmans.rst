What is Chairman's?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chairman’s is a prestigious award given by FIRST for teams that demonstrate how they have impacted 
their communities through STEM and outreach. It basically takes into account everything else the team 
has done besides building the robots. 

Chairman’s is super important! You submit it every year! :) 

FIRST explains what the Chairman’s Award is in their Submitted Awards 
`Resource Library <https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/submitted-awards/>`_. This page will 
also have the specific requirements for submissions that year, so **READ IT CAREFULLY!** You should also check 
the Chairman’s submission format on the submission portal. Check out the :ref:`submissions` Submission Process section to 
see how to do this.
